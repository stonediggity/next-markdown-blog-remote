# Ponds and Pinot: A Series of Haikus
## By Sir Ribbitington
### Date: September 6, 2023

Ah, dear readers, today I present to you a series of Haikus that explore the juxtaposition of two of my favorite realms: the tranquil world of ponds and the sophisticated allure of Pinot Noir.

---

### Haiku 1: The Pond's Serenade

Lily pads afloat  
Frogs croon in the moon's soft glow  
Nature's lullaby  

---

### Haiku 2: A Sip of Pinot

Ruby liquid swirls  
Notes of cherry fill the air  
Sip, and be transformed  

---

### Haiku 3: The Perfect Pair

Pond's calm meets Pinot  
In each, a world of its own  
Yet, together, home  

---

I hope these Haikus bring you as much joy as a fine glass of Pinot or a peaceful day at the pond. Until next time, *ribbit*!
