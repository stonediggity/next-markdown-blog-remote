This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Clone repo to local directory. Then you'll need to run below to install all dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Environment Variables
You'll need to create an .env or .env.local file once you have done the above. You'll need a github repo (SEPARATE TO THE REPO YOU HAVE FORKED TO/FROM) with your mdx files (these are the markdown blog files for the site to access)

```bash
GITHUB_SECRET = <YOUR_SECRET_HERE>

```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
